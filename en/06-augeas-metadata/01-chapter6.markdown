# Augeas metadata #

We have seen earlier that the `/augeas` top node exposes Augeas metadata which can be parsed and modified in the same fashion as the `/files` data.
This chapter will focus on documenting the various parts of the `/augeas` tree and their functions.


## The root node ##


## The version tree ##


## The save node ##


## The load tree ##


## The files tree ##


## The variables tree ##


## The span node ##
