# Using Augeas in Puppet #

Because Augeas is a configuration API, it fits right into tools that are made for configuration management. One of the most widely used of these tools in the open-source world is Puppet, and Augeas is now embedded as a native type in Puppet since version __FIXME__. If Puppet was a chainsaw, Augeas would be a scalpel.

Since Puppet is written in Ruby, the Augeas Puppet type makes use of the Ruby bindings for Augeas.
